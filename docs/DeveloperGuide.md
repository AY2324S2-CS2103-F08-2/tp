# CogniCare Developer Guide

## About CogniCare
As the job climate is worsening, more and more students are not being able to find a job, and increasingly affiliated with mental health issues. This results in an increased workload from a larger number of patients to manage and appointments to schedule. CogniCare is a patient management system, designed to take care of SoC students who suffer from various mental health issues and concerns due to being unable to find internships or jobs.

CogniCare takes care of the load of many tedious tasks such as identifying today's appointments and measuring a patient's satisfaction progress levels over a period of time, until they are finally ready for discharge.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other.
* At shutdown, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletep 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent an outside component from being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml"/>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Patient` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deletep 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletep 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the command is passed to a `CommandParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeletePatientCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePatientCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
2. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to delete a patient).<br>
3. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CommandParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `CommandParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g., during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Patient` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml"/>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AppointmentListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Appointment
#### Implementation
##### Appointment Classes
Appointment is a new feature added to the app. It is a new entity that is related to a `Patient`. An `Appointment` object has the following attributes:
- Appointment ID
- Appointment Start and End Date Time
- Patient ID
- Attended Status
- Feedback Score
- Appointment Description

Appointment ID is a unique identifier for each appointment. It is generated by the system when a new appointment is created.

The Appointment Date Time is the date and time of the appointment.

The Patient ID is the unique identifier of the patient that the appointment is related to.

The Attended Status is a boolean value that indicates whether the patient has attended the appointment.

The Feedback Score is an integer value from 1 to 5 (inclusive) that indicates patient satisfaction.

The Appointment Description is a String that describes the appointment.

##### Appointment Storage
Appointments are stored in the `Model` component as `AppointmentList` which contains `UniqueAppointmentList` object that is parallel similar to `PatientList` storing `UniquePatientList`. 
The `Model` component provides methods to add, delete, and retrieve appointments from `AppointmentList`

Appointment List is saved under a separate file `appointmentList.json` in the data folder, apart from the `patientList.json` file that stores the `patientList` data.


#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: Patient ID**
- In any system that manages individual records, it is critical to ensure that we are able to distinguish between entities (which are patients) in our case.


- **Alternative 1: Using Integer ID as the primary key (Current Approach)**
  - We needed some method to ensure that the patient was unique. The primary solution implemented involves a running integer identifierâ€”which is saved together with each patient. The identifier serves as the primary key for the patient object, similar to how a unique ID in a database ensures each record's uniqueness.
  - This was different from how the AB3 application was originally designedâ€”where the ID followed the natural ordering of the elements in the list.
  - Pros
    - Extremely user-friendly for counsellors as ID is never changed. 
      - A member card displaying the patient ID could potentially be issued to patients.

  - Cons
    - Difficult to implement.
    - There will be "holes" in the sequential ID when records are deleted.

- **Alternative 2: Using Name as the primary key**
  - This approach was quickly deemed unsuitable due to the high probability of name duplication. While names are an important identifier, there is a great risk of collision (i.e. "Jack Tan" versus "Jack Tan Ah Kou"). While this method is sufficient for a non-mission critical address book, our CogniCare application aims to reduce error occurrence.
  - Pros
    - Extremely intuitive for a counselor to type in the patient's name
  - Cons
    - Commands will be extremely long; and challenging to type.
    - The counselor will need to remember exactly how the full name is spelt.
    - May select the wrong patient (i.e., "Jack Tan" versus "Jack Tan Ah Kou").
    
- **Alternative 3: Using Natural Ordering of the names in CogniCare application (AB3 approach)**
  - As we initially strove for a design where the patient identifier to be used like a Foreign Key in the Appointments object, the inconsistent ID would mean that the data integrity for Appointments class would be compromised.
  - Pros
    - Easy to implement (AB3 has already implemented it.)
  - Cons
    - Data Integrity of Appointments will be compromised
    - Every time a patient is deleted, the subsequent IDs will be coalesced.


**Aspect: Search query with AND constraint**
### Querying Patients by different parameters.

<puml src="diagrams/FindPatientSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

In enhancing the search functionality within CogniCare, the implementation of an AND constraint for search queries was paramount. This feature allows counsellors to refine search criteria, leading to more precise and relevant search results. For example, a counsellor can search for a patient using a combination of parameters (partial name AND partial phone number AND partial email address). It is to note that only one parameter is required; the others are optional.

This enhancement was driven by the need for:
1. Improved Search Accuracy: By allowing multiple criteria to be specified, counsellors can narrow down search results to the most relevant patients (as the SoC cohort is large).
2. Efficiency: Enables quicker access to patient records by reducing the time spent sifting through irrelevant patient information.

**Alternative 1: Single Criterion Search (AB3 Approach)**: The original AB3 approach of allowing search based on a single criterion was found to be too limiting for the different needs of patient management in CogniCare.

**Alternative 2: Search Query with OR Constraint:** While also considered, this approach was determined to potentially yield too broad of a search result, undermining the efficiency desired in retrieving patient record.

**Aspect: Appointment ID**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate auto-increasing fixed appointment ID when creating a new appointment. Fail commands that attempt to set the appointment ID still increase the appointment ID.
  - Pros: 
    - Easier to implement.
    - This is the implementation that takes inspiration from DBMS auto-increment.
    - Consistency in appointment ID.
    - Easier to store as a separate file for appointment storage.
  - Cons: Confusion for users who expect appointment ID to increase one by one.
  - Mitigation: Ensure that the appointment ID is unique.
  
- **Alternative 2 (AB3 choice):** No fixed appointment ID. AppointmentID is relative to the Appointment view.
  - Pros: More flexible for users.
  - Cons: More complex to implement. It may lead to inconsistencies between appointments.

**Aspect: Where to store appointments locally**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store appointments in a separate file.
  - Pros: Easier to manage appointments separately from patients.
  - Cons: 
    - More complex to manage two separate files.
    - Time complexity to carry out commands with appointments as it has to read the whole list of appointments.
  - Risks: 
    - May lead to inconsistencies between the two files with regard to ids.
  - Mitigation: Ensure that both files are updated together.
  
- **Alternative 2:** Store appointments as a field in the `Patient` class. Hence, all appointment data will be stored in the same file as the `patientList`.
  - Pros: Easier to manage a single file.
  - Cons: 
    - May lead to a more complex data structure.
    - Delete a patient will cascade delete all appointments.
  - Risks: May lead to performance issues when reading/writing data.
  - Mitigation: Optimize the data structure for reading/writing data.

**Aspect: How to store appointments**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store appointments as a `AppointmentList` in `Model`.
  - Pros: 
    - Easier to design since it is similar to `patientList` implementation.
    - If we want to add more Models, this will be the default implementation
  - Cons:
    - Adding an extra layer of OOP abstraction.
    - May lead to performance issues when reading/writing data (more prone to crashing issues).

- **Alternative 2:** Store appointments as a list of `Appointment` objects in `patientList`.
  - Pros: Easier to manage appointments as a list.
  - Cons: 
    - Reduce in OOP-ness of the code
    - Hard to scale up, as we need to change the whole code base.

## Adding a New Patient

The add patient feature is modified from the original AB3 which allows users to register new students as users and insert them into the application.

The add patient sequence diagram is displayed below:

<puml src="diagrams/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Add Patient Sequence Diagram"/>  

**Implementation**: An observable list is used to store the list of appointments.
`AddPatientCommandParser` obtains the values that correspond to the prefixes such as `p/`, `n/`, `e/`, and `a/` which represent phone, name, email address, and alias accordingly.

This class ensures that
* The data stored must contain the name, phone, and email address corresponding to their respective format.
* Values that are corresponding to each tag are valid.
* There can be multiple aliases (`a/`), but `p/`, `n/`, `e/` may only appear once.
* A unique Id is created for each patient. This ID is strictly increasing and remains tagged to the patient (and does not change its order even if other records prior get deleted).
* Names are also used as a primary key (meaning no 2 users of the same name may be added to the CogniCare application) regardless of case sensitivity and whitespace, i.e. "JEROME CHUA" and "jErOmE    CHuA" are treated the same.

If the constraints are violated, `AddPatientCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` and log the invalid parameter passed into the function.

Otherwise, if the process is successful, a new `Patient` object will be created to add the patient to the CongiCare application.



There are a few notable classes and methods that are used to interact with the add patient command:
1. `AddPatientCommand`:
   1. Defines the add patient command keywords and other error messages.
2. `AddPatientCommand#execute()`
   1. Validates the results for `AddPatientCommandParser#parse()`
   2. If the results are valid, then the specified patient will be added to the CogniCare application.
   3. Throws a `CommandException` if the specified patient is invalid. The new patient is only considered valid if it satisfies storing the required information in the required format.


**Alternatives Considered**
* Using the natural order of the list as the index of the Person. This is sub-optimal as holes in the records may lead to unexpected behaviour when handling the appointments. For example, consider a list with 3 patients. If the second patient is deleted, then the 3rd patient becomes the 2nd patient. This will be confusing for the user. Therefore, we sought to seek a solution to ensure that the studentId always remains unique.
* Completely re-writing AB3's addressbook. This is not practical as our functionalities and use-case is similar to the use case of the AB3 application.


## Querying for Patients
The query patient command allows users to search for patients based on the given criteria. It makes use of the `ListPatientCommandParser` which obtains the values that correspond to the criteria such as `p/`, `n/`, `e/`, and `a/` which represent phone, name, email address, and alias(es) accordingly, and combined with an `AND` logic.

The diagram below shows the sequence diagram for querying patients:
<puml src="diagrams/FindPatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Query Patient Sequence Diagram" />

The command for this operation is `queryp` with at least one or zero parameters. If no parameters (or at least one invalid parameter is passed into the command), the `queryp` command returns all the information of the patients (that is applied without any filters/predicates).

The `ListPatientCommandParser` first checks for the presence of empty arguments / no prefix being specified. If this criterion is true, then all the patients are returned as normal. As such, this class does not throw any exceptions but just returns all the data in the CogniCare application even if the command is malformed (but reaches the `ListPatientCommandParser`).

Otherwise, each of the search terms will be applied to each of the respective fields of the CogniCare application in a case-insensitive format.

**Implementation** There are a few notable features and methods that enable this feature.

1. ListPatientCommand - Command that is executed
2. ListPatientCommandParser - Parses the command and performs the required validation checks


**Alternatives Considered**
- User-Forgiveness _versus_ Strict Error Handling: Returning an error message where the command is correct, but illegal parameters are being supplied, then an error message is displayed. We decided against this approach because this will reduce the "user friendliness" of the application as the user would then have the consult the manual / read the error message to resolve the error.
- Creating a "do-it-all" predicate for the `Patient` class will be less repetitive code as compared to the current approach (`EmailContainsKeywordPredicate.java`, `NameContainsKeywordPredicate.java`, `PhoneContainsKeywordPredicate.java`, `TagContainsKeywordPredicate.java`) which requires more (repetitive code) as compared to making a class such as `StudentContainsKeywordPredicate.java` which would be easier to code - but harder to test and extend in future. Not to mention, this will also increase the difficulty in writing unit tests.
- Using `AND` logic for combining predicates, instead of `OR` predicate - the reason was that since the values already supported partial word matching (i.e. Searching for `coco` in the String `Coconut` will result in the row being returned). As such, using the `OR` logic will lead to too many rows being returned and therefore confusing to the user.
- Using case-insensitive search: the use of case-insensitive search terms for parameter matching provides a more seamless and more user-friendly experience.


## Editing a current Patient
The edit command allows a user to update a patient's information if they relocate, change phone numbers, change email address, etc.

The diagram below shows the sequence diagram for editing a patient: 

<puml src="diagrams/EditPatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Edit Patient Sequence Diagram" />

`EditPatientCommandParser` obtains the patient index and the values that correspond to the prefixes such as `p/`, `n/`, `e/`, and `a/` which represent phone, name, email address, and alias accordingly.

* There can be multiple affiliated-with (`a/`), but `p/`, `n/`, `e/` may only appear once.
* The patient index is based on the unique ID that is tagged to each patient, and is not the natural ordering of the list.
* The edited fields are required to have the same validation as creating a new patient.


If the constraints are violated, `EditPatientCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` due to an invalid patient ID or invalid parameter being parsed.

Otherwise, if the process is successful, the current `Patient` object corresponding to the respective ID will be updated with the edited information.


**Implementation**  
There are a few classes and methods used to interact with the edit patient command.
1. `EditPatientCommand`
    1. Defines the edit patient command keyword and other error messages.
2. `EditPatientCommand#execute()`
    1. Finds the specified patient to edit. Throws a `CommandException` if the patient is not found, or if an invalid index is specified.
    2. Validates the edited Patient, ensuring that the edited Person's name does not exist in CogniCare. Validation checks are performed on the fields as well.
    3. If there is no error, the specified patient is updated and a success message is displayed.
3. `EditPatientCommandParser#parse()`
    1. Parses the edit patient command, ensuring that all parameters provided are valid. A `ParseException` is thrown if there are no parameters specified.
    2. Create an edited patient.
    3. Returns a new `EditPatientCommand`.  

**Alternatives Considered**
* Using the name as the primary key instead of the patient ID - may lead to unexpected deletes as there could be a case where the counselor has two patients of the similar name "Tan Ah Kow" and "Tan Ah". Suppose the counselor wants to delete "Tan Ah", not "Tan Ah Kou" - in this case, the wrong record will be accidentally deleted. Using an integer value as the identifier would eliminate this problem and will also make it much easier for the user to input the commands.
    * Therefore the workflow would be to search for the respective patient for the respective index via the `queryp` command before editing it.

## Deleting an existing patient

The diagram below shows the sequence diagram for querying patients: 
<puml src="diagrams/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Patient Sequence Diagram" />

The delete patients feature allows users to remove patients from CogniCare (whether it is for privacy reasons etc).

The diagram below shows the sequence diagram for deleting patients: <puml src="diagrams/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Patient Sequence Diagram" />

`DeletePatientCommandParser` obtains the patient index that is to be deleted.

* The patient index is based on the unique ID that is tagged to each individual patient and is not the natural ordering of the list.


Otherwise, if the process is successful, the current `Patient` object corresponding to the respective ID will be updated with the deleted patient information containing the phone, email, and respective affiliated-with information.


**Implementation**  
There are a few classes and methods used to interact with the delete patient command.
1. `DeletePatientCommand`
    1. Defines delete patient command keyword and other error messages.
2. `DeletePatientCommand#execute()`
    1. Find the specified patient to delete. Throws a `CommandException` if the patient is not found.
    2. If there is no error, the specified patient is deleted from CogniCare and a success message is displayed.
3. `DeletePatientCommand#parse()`
    1. If the constraints are violated, `DeletePatientCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` due to an invalid patient ID passed.
     2. Returns a new `DeletePatientCommand`


**Alternatives Considered**
* A confirmation dialog when deleting the patients. We decided to not go with this approach as this drastically reduces the speed which the user makes use of the application.
* Deleting the student using the natural order of the list may also result in unintended deletions.

### Add Appointment Feature

The add appointment feature allows users to create a new appointment and insert them into the application.

Below is the add appointment activity diagram.
<puml src="diagrams/AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Add Appointment Activity Diagram" />

**Implementation**
An observable list is used to store the list of appointments.
- The list is initialised as an empty list of type appointments in the beginning.
- A unique identifier is created for each appointment. This identifier is strictly increasing and remains tagged to the appointment (and does not change its order even if other records prior get deleted).

There are a few classes and methods used to interact with the add appointment command.
1. `AddAppointmentCommand`
   1. Define add appointment command keyword and other error messages.
2. `AddAppointmentCommand#execute()`
   1. Validates the results of the `AddAppointmentCommandParser#parse()`
   2. Adds a valid appointment to CogniCare.
   3. Throws a Command Exception if the appointment returned is invalid. The new appointment is considered valid if there is no
      appointment with the same patient id, date, and time, and the date and time do not overlap with another appointment in CogniCare.
3. `AddAppointmentCommandParser#parse()`
   1. Parses the add appointment commands, ensuring that all required parameters are present.
   2. Returns a new `AddAppointmentCommand.`

**Rationale for implementation**
There are a few key features that this module aims to implement
1. Allow users to add new appointments to keep track of all past and upcoming appointments.

**Alternatives considered**
1. Using an array list instead of an observable list. However, the GUI was not able to accurately reflect the new appointment list when new appointments were added.
2. Using the natural order of the list as the index of the `Appointment`. To standardise the implementation throughout the application, we decided to adopt the patient list implementation.
   Therefore, each appointment has a unique identifier that does not change even when the natural order of the list is changed.

### Query Appointment Feature
The query appointment feature allows users to query appointments by specific fields through the use of patient ID or name or appointment ID. Querying by datetime is done via the filter appointment feature.

Below is the sequence diagram for querying appointments

<puml src="diagrams/QueryAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Query Appointment Sequence Diagram" />


And below is the activity diagram when a query appointment command is made

<puml src="diagrams/QueryAppointmentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Query Appointment Activity Diagram" />

**Implementation**
There are a few classes and methods that make this feature work
1. `ListAppointmentCommand` - Command that is executed
2. `ListAppointmentCommandParser` - Parses the command and performs the required validation checks
3. `RelationshipUtil` - In order to check that the specified patient ID is valid, we use a Util class which checks if a patient ID exists in a list of all patients

**Rationale for implementation**
1. This list command adds a unique validation step that checks for a valid patient ID. The rationale behind this is because of the confusion that would come about by listing out an empty list of appointments are querying with an invalid patient ID. For example, if there was no validation, and you run `querya pid/999` and you see no appointments, you might assume that there is no appointment with the patient ID of 999, rather than there is no such patient ID in the first place
   1. Note that patient name is not subject to the same validation because while the existence of a patient ID can be easily verified, the existence of a substring of a name cannot. Furthermore, if you run `querya n/Tom` and no appointments are listed, this concludes that there is no appointment with the patient named "Tom".
2. The query command allows for ease and flexibility in querying, while also providing sufficient validation to bolster and not hinder the querying process. This feature helps to streamline the user experience for users who are fast typists and technically competent.

**Alternatives considered**
1. Initially, the command was only allowed to query just by patient ID and appointment ID. However, this was found to be too restricting on the user as it is unintuitive for the user to remember IDs over names.

### Edit Appointment Feature

The edit appointment feature allows users to update appointment fields in case of any changes to the appointment details.

Below is the sequence diagram for editing an appointment.
<puml src="diagrams/EditAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Edit Appointment Sequence Diagram" width="550" />

**Implementation**
There are a few classes and methods used to interact with the edit appointment command.
1. `EditAppointmentCommand`
   1. Define edit appointment command keyword and other error messages.
2. `EditAppointmentCommand#execute()`
   1. Finds the specified appointment to edit. Throws a `CommandException` if the appointment is not found.
   2. Validates the edited appointment, ensuring that the edited appointment does not exist in CogniCare. Date and time checks are performed as well.
   3. If there is no error, the specified appointment is updated and a success message is displayed.
3. `EditAppointmentCommandParser#parse()`
   1. Parses the edit appointment command, ensuring that all parameters provided are valid. A `ParseException` is thrown if there are no parameters specified.
   2. Creates an edited appointment.
   3. Returns a new `EditAppointmentCommand.`

**Rational for implementation**
1. Users need to be able to update individual appointments in the event that appointment details change.
2. There are also optional parameters present in the add appointment command that users should be able to update.

### Delete Appointment Feature
The delete appointment feature allows users to remove appointments from CogniCare.

Below is the activity diagram for deleting an appointment.
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteAppointmentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Appointment Activity Diagram" />

**Implementation**
There are a few classes and methods used to interact with the delete appointment command.

    1. Defines delete appointment command keyword and other error messages.
2. `DeleteAppointmentCommand#execute()`
    1. Find the specified appointment to delete. Throws a `CommandException` if the appointment is not found.
    2. If there is no error, the specified appointment is deleted from CogniCare and a success message is displayed.
3. `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser#parse()`
    1. Parses the delete appointment command, ensuring that the provided appointment index is valid.
       A `ParseException` is thrown if there are no parameters specified or the appointment index provided is not positive.
    2. Returns a new `DeleteAppointmentCommand`

**Rational for implementation**
1. Users need to be able to delete individual appointments in the event that appointment an appointment is cancelled.

**Alternative considered**
1. Command format `deletea aid/APPOINTMENT_INDEX`. The appointment index prefix `aid/` was deemed not necessary as it is very clear that this delete command only applies to appointments.

### Filter Appointment Feature

The filter appointment feature allows users to filter appointments based on the date and time of the appointment.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Filter Appointment Sequence Diagram"/>

**Implementation**
A predicate was used to filter the list of appointments based on the date and time of the appointment.
Criteria for filtering appointments:
- `StartDateTime` the appointment is before or at (<=) the specific `startDateTime` of the predicate
- `EndDateTime` the appointment is after or at (>=) the specific `endDateTime` of the predicate
  There are a few methods used to interact with the filter appointment command.
1. `FilterAppointmentCommand`
   1. Define filter appointment command keyword and other error messages.
   2. Validates the results of the `FilterAppointmentCommandParser#parse()`
2. `FilterAppointmentCommandParser#parse()`
   1. Parses the filter appointment commands, ensuring that all required parameters are present.
   2. Check if the start date and time happen before the end date and time.
   3. Returns FilterAppointmentCommand
3. `ParserUtil#parseDateTime()`
   1. Parses the date and time of the appointment, ensuring the correct format
4. `ParserUtil#parseEndDateTime()` and `ParserUtil#parseStartDateTime()`
   1. Parses the start and end date and time of the appointment, ensuring correct format from calling `ParserUtil#parseDateTime()`

**Rationale for implementation**
There are a few key features that this module aims to implement
1. Allow users to filter appointments based on the date and time of the appointment.
2. Ensure that the start date and time is before the end date and time.
3. Ensure that the date and time of the appointment is in the correct format.
4. Ensure that the date and time of the appointment is correctly parsed.

**Alternatives considered**
1. Smarter filtering based on the date and time of the appointment. However, this was not implemented as it was not necessary for the current scope of the project.

### Report Patient Feedback Feature
Report patient feedback score is a feature that averages out the feedback scores of all currently filtered appointments. It allows getting the average scores of appointments within a given date range

The overall data flow of patient feedback data is detailed below using a class diagram. 

**Note**: This class diagram doesn't represent the command flow, but rather, how patient feedback report data is stored and retrieved
<puml src="diagrams/PatientFeedbackReportClassDiagram.puml" alt="Report Feedback Class Diagram" />

Below is a sequence diagram of the user flow of the report command
<puml src="diagrams/ReportFeedbackSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Report Feedback Sequence Diagram" />

**Implementation**
1. `PatientFeedbackReport` - A model that contains information from both Patients and Appointments. It uses both data to determine which appointments to calculate the average from
2. `PatientFeedbackReportList` - Contains a list of patient feedback reports
3. `ReportFeedbackCommand` - Reports the average feedback score for a given date range
4. `ReportFeedbackCommandParser`- Parses ReportFeedbackCommand accordingly
5. `FeedbackScore` - Contains a nullable Integer field. If it is null, then there is no rating for the appointment yet

**Rationale for Implementation**
1. High-level structure for `ReportFeedbackCommand`, `ReportFeedbackCommandParser` and `PatientFEedbackReportList` was inspired from previous implementations of similar models
2. Integer was used for `FeedbackScore` because:
   1. We did not want to make FeedbackScore compulsory to add when creating an appointment
   2. The primitive type `int` is not nullable, so we used a wrapper class instead
3. `PatientFeedbackReport` is different from Appointment and Patient because it holds transient data and is dependent on data from the Patient and Appointment models.
   1. Therefore, it was decided that the entire list of appointments and specified patient data should be passed into this object in order to calculate the average feedback score
4. `PatientFeedbackReportList` does not have any direct list modification methods of its own. It only has a generateReportList function which is called every time there is an update to the list of patients or appointments, e.g., filter, add, edit or delete
   1. To achieve such reactivity, `generateReportList()` was called at the end of each of such functions inside `ModelManager`

**Alternatives considered**
1. `PatientFeedbackReport` - We considered just passing the required fields; however, there were a few limitations
   1. Passing only the Patient name and ID
      1. We need the name for sorting and UI purposes, and we need the patient ID to determine which appointments to select. This resulted in 2 fields from the same object, which could be simplified if we just pass in a single Patient object
    2. Passing only the patient's list of appointments instead of all appointments
       1. This quickly proved to be very complex because we would need to filter appointments every time a patient or appointment was updated in the list
2. `FeedbackScore` data representation
   1. A string data type was considered to represent the Feedback Score, however, it simply did not make sense logically-speaking, and thus, we used an Integer instead.
   2. A 0 was considered to represent the null value of a feedback score. This was because we did not have any null fields in the previous code base, with FeedbackScore being the only nullable field. However, having 0 represent the null value is confusing and also prone to error; in case someone decides to edit the feedbackScore to any other value, e.g. -1
3. An observer pattern was considered when implementing the `generateReportList()` functionality, however, it was scrapped because it was already implemented via the `ObservableList` fields and implementing the pattern fully would not be worth the refactor

### Command History

Command history is a feature that aims to improve the user experience for experienced users by allowing them to quickly
navigate through their history of commands to make minor changes. Many features were inspired by macOS's Bash shell

Below is a general user flow of the command history
<puml src="diagrams/command-history/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Command History sequence diagram" />

**Note** 

that the above diagram doesn't capture the audio playback feature because it's not a core part of the feature.

And below are the specific behaviours of the command history module

**Undo**

<puml src="diagrams/command-history/CommandHistoryUndoActivityDiagram.puml" alt="command history undo activity diagram" />

**Redo**

<puml src="diagrams/command-history/CommandHistoryRedoActivityDiagram.puml" alt="command history redo activity diagram" />

**Implementation**

An array list was used to store the history of commands and an index to indicate which command is the history currently
at.
- The list is initialised to have an empty string as the initial element. This is so that our default behaviour of returning an empty string from pressing redo when there is no next command can be easily implemented
- The current command index defaults to 0

There are a few methods used to interact with the command history
1. `getCurrentCommand()` - Gets the command at the current command index
2. `undo()` - Decrements the current command index by 1
    * If the current command index is already 0, it will play a Boop sound to indicate that there is are no more commands left to undo
1. `redo()` - Increments the current command index by 1

Below shows the expected behaviour of the command history from a series of actions.
- red text - denotes where the command index
  is currently pointing at.
- NA - the initial state of the command history
- `execute(args)` - when any command is executed
- `undo()` - decrements the index
- `redo()` - increments the index

Command | Command History
---|---
NA | [<span style="color: red;">""</span>]
`execute("help")` | ["help", <span style="color: red;">""</span>]
`undo()` | [<span style="color: red;">"help"</span>, ""]
`undo()` | [<span style="color: red;">"help"</span>, ""]
`redo()` | ["help", <span style="color: red;">""</span>]
`redo()` | ["help", <span style="color: red;">""</span>]
`undo()` | [<span style="color: red;">"help"</span>, ""]
`execute("query")` | ["help", "query", <span style="color: red;">""</span>]

**Rationale for implementation**

There are a few key features that this module aims to implement

1. Improved user experience for experienced users
    1. Allow users to modify their past commands in a predictable way
    2. Allow users to easily compare past commands in case of mistakes by pressing up and down
2. Mimicking bash shell features
    1. Playing a sound to indicate that there are no more commands left to undo
    2. Empty the input box when there are no more commands left to redo
3. Default empty string in the list
    1. This aims to model what the command history looks like. By doing this, this makes the logic much more straightforward as we don't need to constantly check to return an empty string or not

**Alternatives considered**

1. 2 stacks, one undo and one redo were used at first. However, this had the drawback of not being able to remember commands after undoing and writing a new command.
2. `undo()` and `redo()` both returned the previous and next command respectively - This had a flaw in which the logic of handling the command index became unnecessarily complex as we had to worry about when we incremented/decremented an index. This also made it harder to test the functionality

<!-- @@author vnnamng -->
### Help Feature

<puml src="diagrams/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Help Command Sequence Diagram"/>

The help feature provides users with a URL to the user guide online.

**Rationale for implementation:**

1. Pop-up window with a URL link and a copy button

**Alternative considered:**

1. Display a list of commands directly in the command box
2. Display a full window with a user guide

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
Rayson is a career guidance coach at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and is attached to the School of Computing (SoC) to provide computing students with career advice.

Recently there are many students that are unable to find an internship resulting in stress amongst the student population. This has led to SoC reducing the internship requirements (such as reducing stipend and allowing flexibility in internship periods). However, Rayson's manager, Aaron, thinks that more support needs to be done for the students.

Therefore, Aaron has launched a new initiative to provide counseling for computing students. To assist Rayson in managing the large number of potential students utilising this service, Aaron has employed the services of our team to allow Rayson to better manage the number of appointments.

Rayson is a technically inclined user (alumni of SoC) who is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps, and has the requirements of:

* needing to manage a significant number of contacts due to the large number of students requiring counselling services
* preferring desktop apps over other types
* being able to type fast
* preferring typing to mouse interactions
* being a single-user application.

(Remark: Rayson and Aaron are both fictional characters)

**Value proposition**: 

CogniCare provides a comprehensive set of features that help streamline especially tedious tasks such as:
1. Looking up what appointments are there in a given time period to clear up the schedule
2. Report patient satisfaction levels over a given time period
3. Updating a patient's data across all their appointments. E.g. Updating a person's phone number or removing the patient and their associated appointments from the UI

Furthermore, CogniCare's operations are specialised for technically competent users who type fast.

## Planned Future Enhancements (Beyond `v1.4`)
This section describes the potential enhancements that could be improved in future editions of the application.
* Adding the ability to allow the counselor to secure the application - via a PIN Code feature, and encryption of the JSON file so that data loss does not result in the leakage of highly confidential medical data.
* Enhancing the graphical user interface to make it more user-friendly, i.e. more usage of the mouse as compared to the keyboard.
* Enabling localisation support: In the future more options will be available for users to set their preferred phone number validation types (i.e. US Phone format), Extended Character Set for Naming validation (so that Chinese / Vietnamese / Tamil, etc names can be supported).
* More commands to improve the counsellor workflow: In the initial phase, our primary objective is to concentrate the collection of patient and appointment data. As we progress, we plan to introduce updates and increase more commands to derive new insights from the data. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards working with the users and making these advanced features available.
* More validation checks for when the user manually edits `JSON` files. Currently, adding non-legible value like `null` will cause the app to not launch. A future enhancement will include more validation checks, allowing skipping of non-legible data and detecting invalid data upon launching the app.
* Adding the ability for the GUI to automatically reflect the actual state of data. Currently, after using `editp` command to change the name of a patient, the appointment cards in the appointment list do not reflect the new name of that patient. Hence, a future enhancement will include changing the flow of how the appointment card is generated, enhancing the interactions between GUI and models, and allowing the GUI to reflect the current state of data.
* Add more patient reports to allow for greater utilisation of patient data collected, such as patient attendance reports
* 

## Learning Outcomes
The implementation of the CogniCare application was an extremely challenging endeavour as we needed to morph and reshape the AB3 application in a team-based setting. The transformation process involved significant alternations and enhancements to reach the new requirements of the application.

The team-based setting also exposed us to various crucial skills such as improving our working styles to achieve a high level of collaboration. Skills that are crucial to a Software Engineer such as reviewing Pull Requests (PRs), and providing and receiving feedback from peers are also learned in the course of the project.
